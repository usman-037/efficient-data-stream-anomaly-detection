# **Anomaly Detection in Data Streams**
This repository implements an LSTM model for anomaly detection in data streams. The model is trained on 10,000 data points before deployment. For comparison, Z-score analysis is also applied.

## **Features**
### **Raw Stream Generation:** Generates a continuous data stream with regular patterns, seasonal elements, and random noise.
### **LSTM Model:** Utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model optimized for speed and efficiency.
### **Z-score Analysis:** Provides a comparison method for anomaly detection.
### **Concept Drift Handling:** Capable of adapting to changes in the data distribution over time.
### **Seasonal Variation Adaptation:** Handles seasonal variations in the data.
### **Visualization:** Includes visualizations for the data stream and detected anomalies.
